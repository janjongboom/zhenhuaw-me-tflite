Hi Andrew,

I am writing here to propose a pip package which focuses on parsing TFLite
models. The thing that blocks me from building/releasing directly is the
license issue. I am not sure if it ok to let the community build this or
does it need to be under the control of Google.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts :)

Best regards
Zhenhua


*TL;DR*

I have been using a self-built python package to parse TFLite models, and
integrate the package into our CI infrastructure. Meanwhile, there are many
people who have similar requirements to parse TFLite, for example some
*inference
engine* reads a TFLite model in its frontend module. The community
introduces built C++ parser
<https://github.com/tutorials-with-ci/tflite-model-parse>, or discussing
about python parser
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48485357/how-to-parse-toco-generated-file-tflite-in-python?rq=1>.
As TensorFlow/TFLite somehow becomes a *standard by fact*, it appears to me
that we can build and release pip package from the main TF repository to
empower the community to use them directly rather than searching around and
use flatbuffers stack.

*The proposal includes:*
1. build and open source parser (directly) from schema.
2. build the pip package and release it.
3. modify the package to let it more easy to use, (or even build it into
something like ONNX).

*The discussions (ONLY if the community is going to build such package):*
1. where to release the package, github.com/tensorflowtflite-parser or some
other place such as github.com/jackwish/tflite-parser.
2. naming things...
3. how to maintain it, the release policy.
4. ... some other things...
